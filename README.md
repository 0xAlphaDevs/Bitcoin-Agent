## Future Vision

- Next step is to add much more sophisticated txns on BTC L1. Including etching, airdrop, and trading of Runes with just one NEAR account.

- Further we want user to be able to do Automated Runes trading with AI agent.

- To support this, we will be developing analytics tools to search and filter wallets for a rune directly from agent dashboard that helps user copy trades of a wallet in single click.

- The ultimate goal is to make an agent that can literally do anything and everything on Bitcoin network
